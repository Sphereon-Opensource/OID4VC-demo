<br>SIOP v2 Demo Website      
<br>
<br>
</h2>

#### This is a demo website to test and showcase our ["Self Issued OpenID Provider v2 (SIOP)" library](https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/did-auth-siop).

**NOTE: Please note, this is not intended as production code, nor a starting point for your own implementation.
It is a quite simple and crude implementation to show how the SIOPv2 and OIDC4VP tech can work.**

### Getting started

#### Configure environment

In the **./onto-demo-server folder**, create a file called .env.local and populate it using .env as example. A valid
config will look like this

```dotenv
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5001
COOKIE_SIGNING_KEY=8E5er6YyAO6dIrDTm7BXYWsafBSLxzjb
REDIRECT_URL_BASE=http://192.168.1.200:5001/ext
RP_DID=did:ethr:0xe1dB95357A4258b33A994Fa8cBA5FdC6bd70011D
RP_PRIVATE_HEX_KEY=850e54b92c6291a1ff7b8c3ef30e032571ed77c9e5c78b1cd6ee5fec4fea984f
AUTH_REQUEST_EXPIRES_AFTER_SEC=300
MOCK_AUTH_RESPONSE=false
```

Except for the IP address this is a valid configuration to test with. You will need to replace it with the public IP
interface/address where this
server will be running and make sure it is accessible from your phone and the port is open in the firewall.

#### Build & start

From the root directory

- yarn global add concurrently
- yarn global add ts-node
- yarn install-all
- yarn build
- yarn start

The server will start on port 5001, the client will start & open a browser on http://localhost:3000/

#### Usage

Once the demo site has loaded, you should see the following screen:

![/resources/start-screen.png](/resources/start-screen.png)

Click "Sign in"
A QR code will appear which can be scanned with the mobile OP authenticator module from our SSI-SDK.

![login-qr-screen.png](resources/login-qr-screen.png)

Once the SIOP accepts the receipt of the Presentation Definition the screen will change to:
![login-wait-def-screen.png](resources/login-wait-def-screen.png)

As soon as the SIOP sends in the Verifiable Presentation that conforms to the definition the SIOP will be authenticated:
![login-wait-def-screen.png](resources/vp-received-screen.png)

Note the Information in the top left corner which actually comes from the Verifiable Credential sent by the SIOP.

app "[rn-did-siop-example-app](https://github.com/Sphereon-OpenSource/rn-did-siop-example-app)"
After a successful login two extra page will appear in the menu navigation.

#### Presentation Definition

Since this is just a demo. The Relying Party (Server) asks for a Credential from the SIOP containing a chamber of
commerce credential.
If you want to test it yourself you would need to issue/create a VC containing that info.

Of course you could also change the Server.ts file and adjust the fixed definition in there. We will make this a bit
more configurable soon.
